# criminal-minds-frontend

This Frontend belongs to a simple application that collects quotes from the TV series "Criminal Minds." Its main objective is to showcase the use of the useEffect Hook to retrieve information from the ["Criminal Minds"](https://github.com/HamidGX/criminal-minds-quotes-api) API created by me.

This project is part of the course I designed, HamidGX, with the purpose of teaching React / Node.
